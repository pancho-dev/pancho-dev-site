      <description>Did you ever had trouble with a proxy config? Found that is not simple to test a proxy locally?. Why this? simple, I found many times deploying a proxy configuration to production, even a small change like adding a new path, a redirection or just updating ssl certs, can lead to a disruption or an outage because sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to properly test it before pushing the configuration. So I found a couple od tricks that can help test locally in our laptops or machine before even pushing the code or config giving a safer path to deploy a proxy config.</description>

      <description>This time I will talk about someting I found out very recently, and I found interesting to share this information as it might be handy for developers to use when the use case fits.
So this time I will introduce the ulid. Spoiler alert, it&amp;rsquo;s an ID or at least a data structure that can be used to represent an ID. So why do we have another way of expressing an ID, I won&amp;rsquo;t get into too much details into that but yes there are many ways of defining ids, it can be numerical, using UUIDs, etc.</description>
