      <description>One of my passions in technology is networking, another passion is open source and linux. So sometimes I come across networking software or just to play around with linux standard networking tools like iptables, tc or iproute2, or even play with open source implementations of routing protocols using Quagga/Bird/FRR/go-bgp.
I always found hard when testing this tools to get a proper setup on my laptop. Off course there are some tools that already help us in this regard like GNS3.</description>

There is a handy command that helps save a docker image that is already in the system or already built, there are situations where builds take a long time and building the images in multiple hosts is time consuming, so we can save the image and copy it to other host and import it for reuse.</description>
