      <description>In an earlier post I showed how to create Multinode k8s cluster using ignite and k3s, while this was a good experience I needed to test some other tools, and this time I decided to go for kind (kubernetes in docker). Which looks like a good approach to work with clusters locally and it will still be lightweight as the kubernetes &amp;ldquo;nodes&amp;rdquo; will be actually running as docker containers. This at first glance looks like a easier approach and seems to work in a similar way in Mac, linux or wirndows, which gives a great advantage.</description>

      <description>Sometimes if you are working with kubernetes, or developing applications that require a multinode setup to test some functionality running a multinode cluster is a must, in some cases you could use kind which you can spin up multinode/multimaster clusters on docker, however there might be scenarios were you still need to test or develop functions that need the real feel of a cluster with multiple nodes.
In the past I have run this in my local environment running vms with vagrant and virtualbox, that worked very well, and I still use it for some special scenarios.</description>
