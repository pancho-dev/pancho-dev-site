      <title>What&#39;s a ULID</title>

      <description>This time I will talk about someting I found out very recently, and I found interesting to share this information as it might be handy for developers to use when the use case fits.
So this time I will introduce the ulid. Spoiler alert, it&amp;rsquo;s an ID or at least a data structure that can be used to represent an ID. So why do we have another way of expressing an ID, I won&amp;rsquo;t get into too much details into that but yes there are many ways of defining ids, it can be numerical, using UUIDs, etc.</description>

      <title>Multipass Microk8s Cluster on multiple nodes</title>

      <description>A couple of posts ago I talked about multinode kubernetes clusters and the benefis of them running them for developing automation, testing software and configurations. I still think is that most developers probably don&amp;rsquo;t need this setup or can live with a simpler setup. My motivation is because I work on cloud infrastructure and automation of delployments, databases, and lots of complex scenarios that running single node k8s cluster doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit my needs.</description>

      <title>The misunderstood load average in linux hosts</title>

      <description>Ever wondered when someone runs the command uptime in a linux host what the values in the load average: section mean? well I have wondered about it many times in my carreer. And this should be a simple question to ask a seasoned linux administrator or developer, right? well it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely true, as the load average value in a linux hosts probably is the most misunderstood term and often associated with the wrong concepts.</description>

      <title>Creating Kubernetes Kind Cluster</title>

      <description>In an earlier post I showed how to create Multinode k8s cluster using ignite and k3s, while this was a good experience I needed to test some other tools, and this time I decided to go for kind (kubernetes in docker). Which looks like a good approach to work with clusters locally and it will still be lightweight as the kubernetes &amp;ldquo;nodes&amp;rdquo; will be actually running as docker containers. This at first glance looks like a easier approach and seems to work in a similar way in Mac, linux or wirndows, which gives a great advantage.</description>

      <description>Sometimes if you are working with kubernetes, or developing applications that require a multinode setup to test some functionality running a multinode cluster is a must, in some cases you could use kind which you can spin up multinode/multimaster clusters on docker, however there might be scenarios were you still need to test or develop functions that need the real feel of a cluster with multiple nodes.
In the past I have run this in my local environment running vms with vagrant and virtualbox, that worked very well, and I still use it for some special scenarios.</description>
