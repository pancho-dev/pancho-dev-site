      <title>Working With Open Source Golang Projects</title>

      <description>I have been working with golang projects for quite some time and I found that the usual fork and pull request on github is a bit trickier when working with golang, as golang doesn&amp;rsquo;t have dependency management tools like python has PyPI or npm for NodeJS, etc. Golang dependency management relies on pretty much git tag or commit hashed to specific repos for using golang modules in your code, in my personal opinion I have mixed feelings about the approach, however I am not going to discuss that here, I might do that in another post.</description>

      <title>Linux Router With Containers</title>

      <description>One of my passions in technology is networking, another passion is open source and linux. So sometimes I come across networking software or just to play around with linux standard networking tools like iptables, tc or iproute2, or even play with open source implementations of routing protocols using Quagga/Bird/FRR/go-bgp.
I always found hard when testing this tools to get a proper setup on my laptop. Off course there are some tools that already help us in this regard like GNS3.</description>

      <title>Watch out with cloud storage API calls!!!</title>

      <description>One of the most popular services from cloud providers is cloud storage, to be more specific AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage or any similar service from other cloud providers. This service is very convenient for developers and SREs or System Admins, it solves the problem of managing disks, storage devices , storage servers, etc at a very low cost for storing files, depending on the cloud provider, some of them even offer a staggering 99.</description>

      <title>Lightning Post: Don&#39;t have a Docker registry? save and load to the rescue</title>
      <link>http://pancho.dev/posts/docker-save-restore/</link>

      <description>Whenever someone is working with docker and need to move images between hosts without the need for rebuilding them or hosting a private registry. This lightning post will show us 2 commands that will help us to easy move container images between hosts.
How to save a docker image for reuse in other host? There is a handy command that helps save a docker image that is already in the system or already built, there are situations where builds take a long time and building the images in multiple hosts is time consuming, so we can save the image and copy it to other host and import it for reuse.</description>

      <title>Testing a reverse http proxy</title>

      <description>Did you ever had trouble with a proxy config? Found that is not simple to test a proxy locally?. Why this? simple, I found many times deploying a proxy configuration to production, even a small change like adding a new path, a redirection or just updating ssl certs, can lead to a disruption or an outage because sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to properly test it before pushing the configuration. So I found a couple of tricks that can help test locally in our laptops or machine before even pushing the code or config giving a safer path to deploy a proxy config.</description>

      <description>After about 2 months of launching this blog I realized that creating blog content is a time consuming task. While the whole purpose of my blog is to share some of my experiences and it&amp;rsquo;s my own way to contribute to the open source community (most of what I talk about here is open source tech), I figured that I wanted to keep adding content every week, but some weeks it&amp;rsquo;s much harder than other weeks to create a full blown blog post, I write this in my free time so between work and personal life it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep full blown projects every week.</description>

      <title>Who Stole My Cpu?</title>

      <description>In a previous post I talked about Taming the cpu metrics, while that post was an overview of cpu metrics I thought it was a good topic to emphasize on the cpu steal metric in linux hosts. This is something I recently found and didn&amp;rsquo;t know it even existed, but it can be very useful when running in virtualized environments and helping us tune either the vm, or the physical host that runs the vms.</description>

      <description>In a past blog post I talked about The misunderstood load average in linux hosts, while load average is a good metric to watch in linux systems to catch generic performance problems, it does not reveal what the issue might be. This time I will dig more into cpu metrics collected from a linux system and explain them, for this purpose I will use multipass vms, and will be showing metrics from grafana screenshots which take the data from prometheus and prometheus node exporter (this is actually out of the scope of this post).</description>

      <title>What&#39;s a ULID</title>
      <link>http://pancho.dev/posts/whats-ulid/</link>

      <description>This time I will talk about something I found out very recently, and I found interesting to share this information as it might be handy for developers to use when the use case fits.
So this time I will introduce the ulid. Spoiler alert, it&amp;rsquo;s an ID or at least a data structure that can be used to represent an ID. So why do we have another way of expressing an ID, I won&amp;rsquo;t get into too much details into that but yes there are many ways of defining ids, it can be numerical, using UUIDs, etc.</description>

      <title>Multipass Microk8s Cluster on multiple nodes</title>
      <link>http://pancho.dev/posts/multipass-microk8s-cluster/</link>

      <guid>http://pancho.dev/posts/multipass-microk8s-cluster/</guid>
      <description>A couple of posts ago I talked about multi-node kubernetes clusters and the benefits of them running them for developing automation, testing software and configurations. I still think is that most developers probably don&amp;rsquo;t need this setup or can live with a simpler setup. My motivation is because I work on cloud infrastructure and automation of deployments, databases, and lots of complex scenarios that running single node k8s cluster doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit my needs.</description>

      <title>The misunderstood load average in linux hosts</title>

      <description>Ever wondered when someone runs the command uptime in a linux host what the values in the load average: section mean? well I have wondered about it many times in my career. And this should be a simple question to ask a seasoned linux administrator or developer, right? well it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely true, as the load average value in a linux hosts probably is the most misunderstood term and often associated with the wrong concepts.</description>

      <title>Creating Kubernetes Kind Cluster</title>

      <description>In an earlier post I showed how to create Multi-node k8s cluster using ignite and k3s, while this was a good experience I needed to test some other tools, and this time I decided to go for kind (kubernetes in docker). Which looks like a good approach to work with clusters locally and it will still be lightweight as the kubernetes &amp;ldquo;nodes&amp;rdquo; will be actually running as docker containers. This at first glance looks like a easier approach and seems to work in a similar way in Mac, linux or Windows, which gives a great advantage.</description>

      <description>Sometimes if you are working with kubernetes, or developing applications that require a multi-node setup to test some functionality running a multi-node cluster is a must, in some cases you could use kind which you can spin up multi-node/multi-master clusters on docker, however there might be scenarios were you still need to test or develop functions that need the real feel of a cluster with multiple nodes.
In the past I have run this in my local environment running vms with vagrant and virtualbox, that worked very well, and I still use it for some special scenarios.</description>
